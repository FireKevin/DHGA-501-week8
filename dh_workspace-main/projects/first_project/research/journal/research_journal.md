[Outline]
Collecting secondary data like journals，papers from CNKI. Tried to add the "Flooding area" as an additional layer on the Escaping route map. 

[Data_Collection]
The map project needs additional data, like "Flooding Area" and "Japanese invasion route", to make it more accurate. By searching keywords: "1942","河南", and "1938","花园口", we got several useful secondary sources.

The research goal for this week's is to keep adding more data about the Yellow River flood area(黄泛区), where information is still lacking. So, I tried accessing the Yenching Library and Princeton University's database. By using keyword searching”1942””Henan” and “1938””yellow river”, I found some materials about the 1938 and 1942 events. In terms of content, these are better than the papers I found on CNKI last week. The strong point of these English materials is their solid data support in statistics and summaries. They include detailed descriptions and maps of the Yellow River flood zone, which are missing in Chinese papers. Also, they mix in personal memoirs to make the arguments more reliable.

Take the uploaded document "Between War and Water: Farmer, City, and State in China's Yellow River Flood of 1938–1947" as an example. This article is key in connecting the 1938 Huayuankou dike breach to the 1942 Henan famine. Right in the first paragraph, it clearly explains that the Huayuankou dike breach was a wild and careless military move by the Nationalist government to slow down the Japanese army's attack on Wuhan. From there, it points out that this move didn't really succeed in delaying the Japanese much. Instead, it caused huge damage to nearby areas, especially to rural farmers' lives. The author also talks about the special geography of the Yellow River in China, particularly in Henan. It needs lots of human labor and money to keep the river areas safe. But the man-made dike breach destroyed this protection and led to years of disasters. Another great part of the article is how it shows the flood disaster wasn't just a one-time thing—it was ongoing and repeated with the seasons. Along with heavy taxes from local governments, it became one of the triggers in a chain reaction that caused people to flee during the 1942 Henan famine.
